# Verifying a Lexer and Parser Generator


## Formalization in Isabelle

The Isabelle sources are included in a separate directory called `thys/`

Theory `LocalLexing2.LLEarleyParsing` has been modified to support executability.
Theory `DerivationTrees` contains the basic formalization of derivation trees in CFGs, upon which theory `SPPF` builds for parse tree reconstruction.  
<!--
**LocalLexingParser/LocalLexingParser** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
